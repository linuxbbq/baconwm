baconwm
=======

Automatically populating full-screen wm.

In brainstorming phase currently.

design philosophy
=======
Everything should open full-screen, and new programs spawn a new workspace.  
As a client is closed/killed, the array of workspaces should index and collapse existing workspaces.  
Ctrl+Tab should allow cycling through workspaces. 

todo
======
Everything. :D
